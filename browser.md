## Browser Security

1. Consider using [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) instead of Google Chrome. Remember that, while using Google Chrome, many of your actions, including typing in the onmibar, are sent directly to Google.
3. Examine sites critically while browsing. Identify what is an advertisement or solicitation and what is "normal" content. Don't download things you haven't explicitly searched for.
2. Install the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) extension, which automatically makes your browser using HTTPS (the encrypted form of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) whenever it's available.
4. Install [AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) or [UBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) for Chrome or Chromium to reduce and eliminate visible ads, which these days frequently contain malware.
5. Install Blur or Do Not Track Plus for your respective browser, which make it harder for sites to track you.
5. If you have an elevated threat model, consider using the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/) for considerably elevated (though still not foolproof) security.
