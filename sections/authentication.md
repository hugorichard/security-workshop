## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying an identity. This can involve passwords or passphrases, biometric information, or the use of physical devices or keys.

### Passwords

Everyone should follow the following password guidelines for all passwords:

- Don't reuse passwords across services. (This is probably the most important.)
- Not using birthdays, children's or pet names, or commonly used phrases such as `password` or the name or the site or service
- If you want to use English words in your password, use multiple words to make it a passphrase
- Try to use a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters
- Make sure your password is longer than 8 characters.

If you are operating under elevated threat, use many services, are high profile, or have considerable assets to protect, follow these additional guidelines:

- Use a password manager like LastPass. Create an unusually strong password for your password manager.
- Enable two-factor authentication on all services that offer it
- Actively delete accounts that you do not use
- Don't answer security questions with real information. Instead, decide on false information that you will be able to remember and use that as the answer to security questions. Think of security questions as additional passwords, not as questions.
