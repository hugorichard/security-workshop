### Rules of Thumb

1. Don't start feeling overconfident because you use some unusual piece of security. This can be dangerous and can negate any gains you make from using an otherwise effective tool or approach.
2. Keep your OS and software up to date. Once security vulnerabilities are discovered and reported, they are public knowledge. The only way to protect yourself from reported vulnerabilities is to update to a patched version.
3. Don't repeat passwords. Use strong passwords.
4. Lock your devices before you leave them unattended, even for a few minutes.
5. Don't insert found or unsecured USB devices into your machines.
6. Think about where requests are coming from when you are asked for personal or authenticating information.
6. Don't trust antivirus software to keep you safe. While most experts would still say that having antivirus software is a net positive, they are giving increasingly diminishing returns and in some cases may be counterproductive to security.
7. Shred paper documents before disposing. Wipe hard drives before selling devices using a dedicated wipe utility, and wipe or destroy hard drives before disposing. Note that data can often be recovered even from heavily damaged hard drives, so wiping is still a good idea.
8. Think in terms of whole systems, and put yourself in the mindset of an antagonist. How would you go about compromising yourown security? What's the weakest point?
9. Support organizations such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate) and the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu). Often the best defense are good policy decisions, especially in this fraught landscape.
